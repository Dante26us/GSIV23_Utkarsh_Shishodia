# React + Vite

# Movie App Readme

Welcome to the Movie App! This readme file provides instructions for running the code, highlights of the completed challenge, potential improvements, and some feedback.

## Instructions

To run and test the code, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd your-repo`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Create a `.env` file at the root of the project and add the following:
  VITE_MOVIE_DB_API_KEY=your_api_key
  VITE_MOVIE_DB_BASE_URL=https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/original
  VITE_MOVIE_DB_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_access_token
5. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
6. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:5173` to use the app.

## Elements Done Well

1. **Redux Integration:** The use of `@reduxjs/toolkit` for state management demonstrates proficiency in modern state management techniques. Redux allows for efficient data flow and centralized state control.

2. **React Router Implementation:** The use of `react-router-dom` and `react-router` to handle routing within the application showcases proficiency in navigation and creating dynamic views.

3. **Component Styling with SASS:** Utilizing the `sass` library for styling exemplifies proficiency in using CSS preprocessors to create maintainable and organized styles.

4. **API Integration:** Incorporating the Movie Database API with environment variables shows proficiency in managing sensitive data securely and making API calls to fetch and display movie information.

## Potential Improvements
Given an additional 4 hours, I would focus on the following improvements:
1. **Enhanced UI/UX:** Allocate time to polish the user interface, ensuring a visually appealing and user-friendly design that enhances the overall experience.
2. **Error Handling:** Implement better error handling for API requests and user interactions to provide meaningful feedback to users in case of failures.
3. **Unit Testing:** Write unit tests using tools like `Jest` and `React Testing Library` to ensure code correctness and maintainable test coverage.
4. **Pagination for Search:** If the API supports it, implement pagination for fetching and displaying a larger number of movies, improving app performance and user experience.
5. **Caching and Persistence:** Integrate `localforage` or a similar library for caching API responses and persisting user preferences, enhancing app performance and reducing redundant API calls.
6. **Converting it into PWA**: I would focus on converting the Movie Database App into a Progressive Web App (PWA) to enhance its accessibility and user experience across various devices.

## Feedback
The challenge was well-structured and effectively assessed proficiency in React, state management, API integration, and styling. Providing more detailed instructions for setting up environment variables and API keys would further improve the challenge experience.
Your feedback is greatly appreciated and will help me improve my skills further. Thank you!
